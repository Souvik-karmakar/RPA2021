To prove the Euler formula, we expand e", cos 9, and sin 0 using a Ma.claurin series 6 The Euler formula states that

Hence, it follows that
Using (B,3) in (B,2) yields = cos 9 + j sin 0 The graphical representation of a number z and its conjugate z* is depicted in Fig,
B,2. Observe that z* is a mirror image of z about the horizontal axis. To find the
conjugate of any number, we need only to replace j by —j in that number (which
is the same as changing the sign of its angle).
The sum of complex number and its conjugate is a real number equal to twice
the real part of the number:
z + z* = (a + jb) + (a — 5b) = 20 2 Rez (B.10a)
(B.4)
Thus, a complex number can be expressed in Cartesian form a + jb or polar form The product of a complex number z and its conjugate is a real number Iz12,
reje with a = r cos 9,
and the square of the magnitude of the number: ¯ + b2 = Izt2
zz* = (a + — 5b) —

Observe that r is the distance of the point z from the origin. For this reason,
r is also called the magnitude (or absolute value) of z and is denoted by Izl.
Similarly 0 is called the angle of z and is denoted by Zz. Therefore
IZI = r, In a complex plane, reje represents a point at a distance r from the origin and
at an angle e with the horizontal axis, as shown in Fig. B.3a. For example, the
number —1 is at a unit distance from the origin and has an angle or —T (in fact,
any odd multiple of ±ff), as seen from Fig. B.3b. Therefore,
